Udacity project - Blog: Explaning variation in prices on AirBnB


# Which variables determine prices for overnight stays on the platform AirBnb?


AirBnb is an important platform for privately renting out apartments and single rooms: Prices for apartments, however, vary, even within one city. In this blog post, I ask which variables determine the price for overnight stays on the platform AirBnb and try to develop a simple tool that can effectively predict prices. To do so, I use Seattle AirBNB Data which includes information on prices, but many other variables that potentially affect the price a host may charge such as the characteristics of the apartment, information on the host or review rating scores.

First, I take a closer look at the distribution of prices with the Seattle AirBNB Data to identify the existing variation. Then, I study the relation between prices, characteristics of the apartment, review rating scores and information on the host in three separate analysis. Finally, I build a prediction model that effectively predicts the price a new host may charge for an overnight stay. I hope that this tool will be helpful for anyone who is thinking about renting out his or her apartment/room.
